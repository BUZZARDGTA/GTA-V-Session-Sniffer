"""Reason-based process suspension manager for the global GTA5 process.

This module provides a singleton manager that controls suspension and resumption
of the single, globally-resolved GTA5 process based on multiple concurrent
"reasons" (e.g. detections, player events, manual overrides). It ensures the
process is only suspended once and only resumed when all active reasons are resolved.
