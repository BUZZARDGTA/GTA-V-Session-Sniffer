"""GTA5 process detection and immutable state snapshot.

Detects the currently running GTA V process (Legacy `GTA5.exe` or Enhanced
`GTA5_Enhanced.exe`), verifies its Authenticode signature to reject impostor
executables that merely reuse the process name, and exposes the result as an
immutable `GTA5Status` snapshot.

    """Return a `GTA5Status` snapshot for the currently running GTA5 process plus its process handle.

    Scans all running processes for `GTA5.exe` or `GTA5_Enhanced.exe`
    (legacy retail and enhanced PC versions respectively) using a
    case-insensitive filename stem match, then verifies the binary carries
    a valid Authenticode signature to reject any impostor executable that
    merely reuses the GTA5 process name.

    The full scan is the expensive part: resolving each process `exe` opens a handle to
    every running process. So when `cached_proc`/`cached_status` describe a process a
    previous call already validated, the fast path re-queries only that single PID:
    `is_running()` confirms it is still the same process (it compares the OS creation
    time, so a dead PID or a PID reused by another process both fail), and a single
    `status()` read refreshes the suspended flag. Because a live PID maps to one
    immutable executable image for its whole lifetime, the already-validated signature
    still holds, so the full scan and Authenticode check are skipped entirely. Any
    change (process gone or PID reused) fails `is_running()` and falls through to a
    fresh scan + signature check, preserving impostor rejection.

    Args:
        cached_proc: The `ProcessInfo` returned by the previous call, re-queried
            directly to avoid a full scan. Pass `None` to force a full scan.
        cached_status: The `GTA5Status` returned by the previous call, supplying the
            already-resolved executable path reused on the fast path.

    Returns:
        A `(GTA5Status, ProcessInfo | None)` tuple. `GTA5Status.path` is set to the
        resolved executable path when found, or `None` (with all boolean flags `False`)
        when neither version is running. The returned process handle should be passed
        back as `cached_proc` on the next call, or is `None` when nothing was found.
